# Visualizing business and political ties of Trump staffers #

This is the code for the web app "Visualizing Trump's Swamp." [Click here](http://pictograf.org/visualizing-trump-swamp/) to visit.

To illustrate the many potential conflicts of interests that political appointees in U.S. President Donald Trump's administration may have, I used a parallel coordinates plot to show their connections to businesses and lobbying firms. 

## Data sources ##
Most of the data came from an [open database](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/trump-administration-political-appointees) created by ProPublica, while background information was gathered from reporting done by the New York Times, the Washington Post, and a report by Senator Elizabeth Warren's office.
